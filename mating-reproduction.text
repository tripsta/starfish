What is the gestational period of the animal ? Starfish are broadcast spawners (which involves external fertilisation) and therefore are not viviparous, consequently they do not have a gestation period. The time taken for a fertilised starfish egg to develop into a baby starfish is about 2 months depending on species.

How many offspring does it typically have at a time ? Most species are usually splitting in two. A large female becomes 2 males and each male when they grow they become female and the procedure goes along.

How long do the offspring live with the parent ? There isn't any specific rule for an offspring living with the parent.
