Feeding Habits:
Sea stars flip their stomachs out through their mouth and digest their prey from the inside out. When the animal is completely digested the stomach is pulled back into the sea star's body.

Protection from predators:
Sea stars have the remarkable ability to regrow their arms if they are damaged or eaten by predators.

Sleep:
Because starfish are too primitive to have consciousness, their sleeping and waking cycles can only be determined by different firing rates of nerves in response to changes in light intensity.
